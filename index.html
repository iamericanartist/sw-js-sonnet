	<div id="sonnet">
		How like a winter hath my absence been
		From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
		What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
		What old December's bareness everywhere! 
		And yet this time removed was summer's time;
		The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
		Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
		Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
		Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
		But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;
		For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
		And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
		Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
